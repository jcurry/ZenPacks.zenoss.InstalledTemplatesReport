The ZenPack provides a report of all the Monitoring Templates installed in a Zenoss instance, drawing together many different attributes that are not otherwise found in a text format such as:

* Template Name
* Device Class
* ZenPack Name
* DataSources
* Thresholds
* Graph Definitions

The user has the ability to view the templates by sorting through Template Name, Device Class or ZenPack Name.
